# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Notes

## HTML

### Document Structure
- Well-structured HTML document with essential tags like `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Appropriately used `<meta>` tags for character set and viewport settings.

### Responsive Images
- Implemented the `<picture>` element with multiple `<source>` tags for responsive images based on different screen widths.

### Dialog Element
- Implemented a modal using the `<dialog>` element, providing a native way to create dialogs in HTML.

## CSS

### Header and Footer Styling
- Consistent styling for the header and footer with a uniform background color, height, and padding.
- Effective use of flexbox for centering content in the header and footer.

### Image Styling
- Styling for the `.image` class with 100% width, 80vh height, and object-fit: cover for responsive and visually appealing images.

### Container Text Styling
- Styling for `#container-text` with absolute positioning and a centered transform for placing text over the image.

### Button Styling
- Styling for `#container-button` with absolute positioning, background color, and padding for a visually prominent button.

## JavaScript

### Dialog Interaction
- Simple and effective JavaScript code for opening and closing the dialog.
- Proper use of `dialog.showModal()` and `dialog.close()` in response to button clicks.

### Element Selection
- Use of `document.querySelector` to select the dialog element and `document.getElementById` to select the button and cancel button.
